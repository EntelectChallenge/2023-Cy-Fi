# Starter Bots

Entelect provides starter bots for the following languages:

* .Net Core (C#) - to be added
* Python - Available 😊
* JavaScript - Available 😊
* Java - to be added
* C++ - to be added
* Kotlin - Available 😊

Starter bots are the bare essentials you need to get going with very little decision making capability. They are built to be able to do the following:

- Connect to SignalR
- Register with a token and nickname to the runner
- Listen for Game State Published events
- Respond to Game State Published events with a new random action

The reference bot (to be added), on the other hand, is capable of playing a game from start to finish with some cleverness built in. This is there to help contestants who want something a bit smarter to work from, and also provides a benchmark against which to run your bot.

## Bot versions

- NodeJS = 14
