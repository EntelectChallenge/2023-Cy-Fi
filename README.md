```

## Step 3 - Upload
Sign up to the player portal [here](https://challenge.entelect.co.za/login), and follow the steps to upload your bot to take part in tournaments!

## Step 3 - Improve
Change some of the provided logic or code your own into one of the given starter bots and upload it to the player portal, and see how you stack up against the rest!

## WIN!!!

## Project Structure

In this project you will find everything we use to build a starter pack that you can use to run a bot on your local machine. This project contains the following:

1. **2023-CyFi** - This is the base project is contains the following files
    * **engine** - The engine is responsible for enforcing the rules of the game, by applying the bot commands to the game state if they are valid.
    * **runner** - The runner is responsible for running matches between players, calling the appropriate commands as given by the bots and handing them to the engine to execute.
    * **logger** (WIP ðŸ”§) - The logger is responsible for capturing all changes to game state, as well as any exceptions, and write them out to a log file at the end of the game.
4. **starter-bots** (WIP ðŸ”§) - Starter bots with limited logic that can be used a starting point for your bot. This folder also contains a bot called `ReferenceBot (Coming soon)`, you can use this bot to test your bot against!

This project can be used to get a better understanding of the rules and to help debug your bot.

Improvements and enhancements will be made to the game engine code over time. The game engine will also evolve during the competition after every battle, so be prepared. Any changes made to the game engine or rules will be updated here, so check in here now and then to see the latest changes and updates.

The game engine has been made available to the community for peer review and bug fixes, so if you find any bugs or have any concerns, please [e-mail us](mailto:challenge@entelect.co.za) or discuss it with us on the [Challenge forum](http://forum.entelect.co.za/), alternatively submit a pull request on Github and we will review it.

## Starter Pack - coming soon
The starter pack will provide you with everything that you'll need to run your first bot and compete in this year's challenge. To get the starter pack, simply download the latest release found [here]

More information on how to use this starter pack is included in the readme you'll receive inside it, as well as [here]
## Submission Process

We have automate submissions through GitHub!

For more information, sign up for the player portal [here](https://challenge.entelect.co.za/login), and follow the steps!


## Right, I'm ready. How do I build my own bot?

Great! We're super excited to see how well you do!
